  description: This land-focused study includes coupled model results for the historical experiment from the CMIP6 era. We also use this as a testing ground to include new datasets and additional models. If you have a suggestion of a reference dataset or would like to request we include a model, please raise an <a href="https://github.com/rubisco-sfa/ILAMB-Data/issues">issue</a>.

  description: While the focus of ILAMB has been on land, we also have used the software to compare ocean model output which we refer to as International Ocean Model Benchmarking (IOMB). This study is analagous to the land comparison of CMIP5 and CMIP6 era models over the historical period.
