Help us learn what scientists think about model performance by
evaluating pairs of model biases on this feedback
[form](https://www.ilamb.org/crowdsource/). Simply click on which bias
plot you consider to be 'better' from the 20 randomly given
pairs. While our intention is for you to select the model with the
lower error relative to observations, please use whatever definition
of 'better' makes sense to you as you examine the differences between
the plots. We will use your collective responses to evaluate how well
our methodolgy captures community opinion. For context, each plot
represents either the Gross Primary Productivity (gpp), Sensible Heat
(hfss), or Surface Air Temperature (tas) bias of a model in the CMIP5
or CMIP6 era, relative to a reference data product. When you are
finished, click the 'complete' button to see how well your choices
align with our current methodologies.
