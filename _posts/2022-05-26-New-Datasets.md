We have added 5 new datasets to the ILAMB collection. Please run `ilamb-fetch` to update your local collection and check [ilamb.cfg](https://github.com/rubisco-sfa/ILAMB/blob/master/src/ILAMB/data/ilamb.cfg) for details on how to include them in your local runs. Alternatively you may browse some [results](https://www.ilamb.org/CMIP6/historical/) against a subset of CMIP6 models. The new additions include:

* Biological Nitrogen Fixation from [Davies-Barnard](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019GB006387)
* Gross Primary Productivity, Sensible and Latent Heat from [WECANN](https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-4101-2017) (Water, Energy, and Carbon with Artificial Neural Networks)
* Latent, Sensible, and Ground Heat Flux, Runoff, Precipitation and Net Radiation from [CLASS](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-19-0036.1) (Conserving Land-Atmosphere Synthesis Suite)
* Biomass from [ESACCI](http://dx.doi.org/10.5285/5f331c418e9f4935b8eb1b836f8a91b8) (European Space Agency, Biomass Climate Change Initiative)
* Surface Soil Moisture from [WangMao](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/13/4385/2021/)
