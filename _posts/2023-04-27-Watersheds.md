The Environmental System Science (ESS) Cyberinfrastructure Model-Data Integration Working Group organized a 2-part virtual hackathon which featured ILAMB during the 2nd session. These sessions were organized by Xingyuan Chen (PNNL) and Forrest Hoffman (ORNL) and supported by the RUBISCO SFA, InteRFACE SFA, COMPASS-GLM SFA, PNNL Watershed SFA, NGEE Arctic SFA, ORNL TES SFA, and E3SM SFA. Our portion of the virtual hackathon focus on adapting ILAMB for watershed analysis.
