We maintain a collection of reference datasets which have been
formatted following <a href="https://cfconventions.org/">CF
conventions</a>. Please note that while we work to keep this
collection up to date, much of the data has been first downloaded from
primary sources and then reformatted for use in our system. Please
check the global attributes of the files for reference
information. This collection is available for download via the ILAMB
software
system. After <a href="https://www.ilamb.org/doc/install.html">installing</a>
the ILAMB python package, you can use
the <a href="https://www.ilamb.org/doc/ilamb_fetch.html">ilamb-fetch</a>
utility to download or update our collection of reference data.

<p>
Identifying and adding new datasets is a continual effort which we
coordinate via
the <a href="https://github.com/rubisco-sfa/ILAMB-Data">ILAMB-Data</a>
Github repository. Please consider submitting
an <a href="https://github.com/rubisco-sfa/ILAMB-Data/issues">issue</a>
if you have a suggestion. 

<h2>ILAMB Collection</h2>
Populate a table automatically from ILAMB-Data so it is always up to date.

<h2>IOMB Collection</h2>
Populate a table automatically from IOMB-Data.
