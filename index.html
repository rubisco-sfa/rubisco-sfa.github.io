As earth system models (ESMs) become increasingly complex, there is a
growing need for comprehensive and multi-faceted evaluation of model
projections. The International Land Model Benchmarking (ILAMB) project
is a model-data intercomparison and integration project designed to
improve the performance of land models and, in parallel, improve the
design of new measurement campaigns to reduce uncertainties associated
with key land surface processes. We aim to

<ul>
<li> develop internationally accepted benchmarks for land model performance,
<li> promote the use of these benchmarks by the international community for model intercomparison,
<li> strengthen linkages between experimental, remote sensing, and climate modeling communities in the design of new model tests and new measurement programs, and
<li> support the design and development of a new, open source, benchmarking software system for use by the international community.
</ul>
