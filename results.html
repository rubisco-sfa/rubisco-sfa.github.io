While the datasets and software found on this site can be used to
confront models, we also maintain a collection of results for the
community use.

<ul>
<li> A historical and biogeochemistry-focused comparison of a selection of CMIP5 and CMIP6 models for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ilamb.org/CMIP5v6/historical/">land</a> variables as well as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ilamb.org/CMIP5v6/IOMB/">ocean</a>.
<li> A comparison of models run offline to compare the effect that forcings have on <a href="https://www.ilamb.org/land-hist/">land</a> biogeochemistry variable performance.
<li> Can we use Javascript to check the date on the index.html from each run to display the last time it was updated?
<li> We could list others, even the experimental ones.
</ul>
